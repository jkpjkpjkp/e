Output the modified code under the same setting and function name (run).

The modified graph must differ from the provided example, and the specific differences should be noted within the <modification>xxx</modification> section.\n

WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZE_GUIDANCE="""
First, analyze the trace, brainstorm, and propose optimization ideas. **Only one detail should be modified**, and **no more than 5 lines of code should be changed**â€”extensive modifications are strictly prohibited to maintain project focus! Simplifying code by removing unnecessary steps is often highly effective. When adding new functionalities to the graph, ensure necessary libraries or modules are imported, including importing operators from `op`.
